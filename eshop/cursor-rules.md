All variables MUST be declared as final unless they need to be modified. This includes:
- Method parameters
- Local variables
- Loop variables
- Collection variables
- Object references

The only exceptions are:
- Variables that are modified within the method
- Variables used in try-with-resources blocks
- Variables that are part of a builder pattern
